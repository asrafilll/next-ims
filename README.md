# Using This Boilerplate

To use this boilerplate for a new project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/next-ims.git [new-project-name]

2. Navigate to the new project directory:
   cd [new-project-name]

3. Remove the existing Git history:
   rm -rf .git

4. Initialize a new Git repository:
   git init

5. Update the project name and other details in `package.json` and other relevant files.

6. Create a new repository on GitHub for your new project.

7. Set the new remote origin:
   git remote add origin https://github.com/[your-username]/[new-project-name].git

8. Stage all files, commit, and push to the new repository:
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git push -u origin main

Remember to review the code and modify any project-specific configurations as needed for your new project.
